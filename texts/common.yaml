  title: High quality Fil<br />d'Ecosse cotton
  text: >
    Fil d‘Ecosse ist reine „Karnak“ Baumwolle aus dem ägyptischen Nil-Delta.
    Nach der Entfaltung unter der südländischen Sonne werden die Fasern und
    Samen mühevoll aus der Baumwollwatte herausgekämmt, um ein Produkt von
    purer Reinheit und Weichheit zu erhalten. Italienische Spinnereien stellen
    aus den extralangen Fasern ein Garn her, das doppelt gezwirnt eine besondere
    Festigkeit und hohe Strapazierfähigkeit bietet. Durch die zusätzliche
    Veredlung des Merzerisierens, erhält Fil d‘Ecosse seinen seidigen Glanz
    und einmalige Farbintensität.

  title: The History of Liberty

      Arthur Lasenby Liberty was born in Chesham, Buckinghamshire in 1843.
      He was employed by Messrs Farmer and Rogers in Regent Street in 1862,
      the year of the International Exhibition at Kensington in London. By
      1874, inspired by his 10 years of service, Arthur decided to start a
      business of his own, which he did the next year.
    - >
      With a £2,000 loan from his future father-in-law, Arthur Liberty
      accepted the lease of half a shop at 218a Regent Street with only
      three staff members.
    - >
      The shop opened during 1875 selling ornaments, fabric and objets d'art
      from Japan and the East. Within eighteen months Arthur Liberty had repaid
      the loan and acquired the second half of 218 Regent Street. As the business
      grew, neighbouring properties were bought and added.
    - >
      In 1884 Liberty introduced the costume department into the Regent Street store,
      directed by Edward William Godwin (1833–86). Godwin was a distinguished architect.
      He was a founding member of the Costume Society in 1882. He and Arthur Liberty
      created in-house apparel to challenge the fashions of Paris.
    - >
      In 1885, 142–144 Regent Street was acquired and housed the ever-increasing
      demand for carpets and furniture. The basement was named the Eastern Bazaar,
      and was the vending place for what was described as "decorative furnishing objects".
      He named the property Chesham House after the place in which he grew up. The
      store became the most fashionable place to shop in London and Liberty fabrics
      were used for both clothing and furnishings. Some of its clientele was exotic,
      and included famous Pre-Raphaelite artists.
    - >
      In November 1885, Liberty brought forty-two villagers from India to stage a living
      village of Indian artisans. Liberty's specialized in Oriental goods, in particular
      imported Indian silks, and the aim of the display was to generate both publicity and
      sales for the store. However, it was a disaster commercially and publicly, with
      concern about the way the villagers were put on display.
    - >
      During the 1890s Arthur Lasenby Liberty built strong relationships with many English
      designers. Many of these designers, including Archibald Knox, practised the artistic
      styles known as Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau, and Liberty helped develop Art
      Nouveau through his encouragement of such designers. The company became associated
      with this new style, to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau became known as the
      Stile Liberty, after the London shop.

      The store became one of the most prestigious in London.
